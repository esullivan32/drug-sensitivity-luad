# drug-sensitivity-luad

## Overview
Final project in my BI410 - Data Visualization course. The goal for this project was to use a large-scale dataset of my choice to create visualizations to answer a scientific question. I chose to explore the relationship between target diversity and sensitivity variability in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) drug response data. The dataset used for this project is the anticancer drug dataset from Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC), which can be found [here](https://www.cancerrxgene.org/downloads/anova). 

## Methods
- Language Used: R
- Packages used: `tidyr`, `dplyr`, `ggplot2` from `tidyverse`
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Data manipulation using `dplyr`
- Creation of visualizations using `ggplot2`
